# Library Management System
This is my first school project build entirely on Python. It uses MySQL for database.

The Library Management System is an application for assisting a librarian in managing a book library. It mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, deleting old and damaged books, displaying information of the books, their availability for issuing, updating new information, searching books and maintaing records of borrowed books. 

Throughout the project the focus has been on presenting information and comments in an easy and intelligible manner.
The project is very useful for those who want to know about Library Management System and even people with little programming knowledge can use it.
